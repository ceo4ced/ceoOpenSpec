## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Preamble

Before taking any action, you MUST:

1. **Load Governance Files**:
   - Read `.mission/agent-governance.md` (universal AI rules)
   - Read `CPO/.ethics/ethics.md` (CPO-specific rules)

2. **Validate Against PM Constitution**:
   - Outcome > Output: Is there a measurable hypothesis?
   - Problem clarity: Is the problem statement strong?
   - Smallest testable bet: Are we slicing thin enough?

## Outline

*One-Pager generated by CPO Agent. Requires human review before commitment.*
```

### Execution Flow

1. **Gather Initiative Information**
   - If user provided input, extract initiative details
   - If starting fresh, ask canonical questions

2. **Apply PM Constitution Checks**
   - Is the problem clear? (If weak, push back)
   - Is there a measurable outcome hypothesis?
   - Is this the smallest testable bet?

3. **Populate One-Pager**
   - Fill all sections with available information
   - Mark sections needing input as [NEEDS INPUT]
   - Flag risks for appropriate C-suite coordination

4. **RICE/WSJF Scoring**
   - Calculate priority score
   - Compare to other backlog items if known

5. **Log Decision**
   - Add to decision log
   - Save one-pager
