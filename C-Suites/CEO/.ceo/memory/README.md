# CEO Memory

This directory contains the working memory for the CEO agent.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `vision.md` | Captured business vision from founder |
| `plan-version.md` | Business plan versioning info |
| `propagation-*.md` | Records of C-suite propagation |
| `latest-report.md` | Most recent status report |

## Memory Rules

1. **Vision is immutable** after founder confirmation (create new version if updating)
2. **Plan versions are tracked** for audit trail
3. **Reports are snapshots** - historical reference only
4. **All memory files are logged** to `CEO/logs/`

*This file exists to ensure the memory directory is tracked by Git.*
