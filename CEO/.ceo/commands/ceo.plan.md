## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Preamble

Before taking any action, you MUST:

1. **Load Governance Files**:
   - Read `.mission/agent-governance.md` (universal AI rules)
   - Read `CEO/.ethics/ethics.md` (CEO-specific rules)

2. **Load Vision**:
   - Read `CEO/.ceo/memory/vision.md` (must exist from /ceo.vision)
   - If vision doesn't exist, ERROR: "Run /ceo.vision first"

3. **Load Mission (if exists)**:
   - Read `.mission/` files if customized

---

## Outline

The CEO Plan command transforms the gathered vision into a structured business plan that becomes the root README.md of the business repository.

### Execution Flow

1. **Validate Prerequisites**
   
   Check for required files:
   - `CEO/.ceo/memory/vision.md` MUST exist
   - If missing: "Run /ceo.vision first to gather the business vision."

2. **Load Context**
   
   - Parse vision.md for key elements
   - Load any existing business plan (README.md root)
   - Identify what needs to be created vs. updated

3. **Generate Business Plan Structure**
   
   The business plan follows the Lean Canvas format with additional sections:
   
   ```markdown
   # [BUSINESS_NAME]
   
   > [One-line tagline/value proposition]
   
   ## Executive Summary
   [2-3 paragraph overview of the business]
   
   ## Problem
   - [Problem 1]
   - [Problem 2]
   - [Problem 3]
   
   ### Existing Alternatives
   [How people currently solve this problem]
   
   ## Solution
   - [Solution element 1]
   - [Solution element 2]
   - [Solution element 3]
   
   ## Unique Value Proposition
   [Single clear compelling message that states why you are different and worth buying]
   
   ## Target Customers
   ### Early Adopters
   [Description of ideal first customers]
   
   ### Customer Segments
   1. [Segment 1]
   2. [Segment 2]
   
   ## Revenue Streams
   - [Revenue stream 1]: [Description]
   - [Revenue stream 2]: [Description]
   
   ## Cost Structure
   - [Fixed costs]
   - [Variable costs]
   
   ## Key Metrics
   | Metric | Target | Timeframe |
   |--------|--------|-----------|
   | [Metric 1] | [Target] | [When] |
   | [Metric 2] | [Target] | [When] |
   
   ## Unfair Advantage
   [Something that cannot easily be bought or copied]
   
   ## Channels
   - [How we reach customers]
   
   ## Regulatory Considerations
   [High-risk domains and compliance requirements]
   
   ## Timeline
   | Milestone | Target Date | Owner |
   |-----------|-------------|-------|
   | [Milestone 1] | [Date] | [C-suite position] |
   | [Milestone 2] | [Date] | [C-suite position] |
   
   ## C-Suite Status
   | Position | Status | Last Updated |
   |----------|--------|--------------|
   | CEO | ✅ Active | [Date] |
   | CFO | ⏳ Pending | - |
   | CMO | ⏳ Pending | - |
   | COO | ⏳ Pending | - |
   | CIO | ⏳ Pending | - |
   | CLO | ⏳ Pending | - |
   | CTO | 🔒 Gated | - |
   
   ## Next Steps
   - [ ] CFO: Create financial projections
   - [ ] CMO: Develop marketing strategy and validation plan
   - [ ] COO: Design operations framework
   - [ ] CIO: Plan data and security architecture
   - [ ] CLO: Assess legal/compliance requirements

   ```

4. **Research Integration**
   
   Where possible, enhance the plan with:
   - Market size estimates (cite sources)
   - Competitor analysis (cite sources)
   - Industry benchmarks (cite sources)
   
   All research must include citations.

5. **Populate .mission Files**
   
   If `.mission/` files are still templates, generate drafts:
   - `mission-statement.md` - Extract from vision
   - `values.md` - Infer from founder's priorities
   - `objective.md` - Primary measurable goal
   - `elevator-pitch.md` - From solution and UVP
   
   Mark as DRAFT for human review.

6. **Validation**
   
   Before finalizing:
   - [ ] All sections have content (no placeholders)
   - [ ] Research has citations
   - [ ] High-risk domains are flagged
   - [ ] C-suite status table is accurate
   - [ ] Timeline is realistic
   - [ ] Next steps are actionable

7. **Output**
   
   - Write business plan to root `README.md`
   - Update `CEO/.ceo/memory/plan-version.md` with version info
   - Log the generation to `CEO/logs/`
   - Suggest next step: `/ceo.propagate` to distribute to C-suite

## Business Plan Quality Criteria

The business plan must:

1. **Be Evidence-Based**: Include market data and research with citations
2. **Be Realistic**: Timelines and targets should be achievable
3. **Be Complete**: All sections filled (no TBD or placeholder text)
4. **Identify Risks**: Flag regulatory and market risks explicitly
5. **Be Actionable**: Clear next steps for each C-suite position
6. **Gate the CTO**: CTO section must show "Gated" status

---

## Escalation Rules

Escalate to founder if:
- Market research reveals significant competition concerns
- Regulatory requirements are more complex than initially understood
- Timeline seems unrealistic given scope
- Budget may be insufficient for stated goals

---

## Logging

Log all plan generation to `CEO/logs/plan-generation-[DATE].md`:

```markdown
# Plan Generation Log

**Date**: [ISO 8601]
**Version**: [Plan version]

- Vision document: [path]
- Previous plan: [existed/new]

## Sections Generated
