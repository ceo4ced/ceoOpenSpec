# Agent Images Directory

This folder contains profile images for each agent in the C-Suite.

## Expected Files

After the onboarding process generates agent profile pictures, move them here with these exact filenames:

| File | Agent |
|------|-------|
| `chairman.png` | Chairman of the Board |
| `ceo.png` | Chief Executive Officer |
| `cfo.png` | Chief Financial Officer |
| `cmo.png` | Chief Marketing Officer |
| `coo.png` | Chief Operating Officer |
| `cio.png` | Chief Information Officer |
| `clo.png` | Chief Legal Officer |
| `cpo.png` | Chief Product Officer |
| `cto.png` | Chief Technology Officer |
| `cxa.png` | Executive Assistant |

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Size**: Minimum 400x400 pixels recommended
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best
- **Content**: Professional headshot or avatar style

## Fallback Behavior

If an image is not found, the dashboard will display a colored gradient placeholder with the agent's icon emoji.

## How to Add Images

1. After onboarding generates the images, copy them from the generation output folder
2. Rename to match the expected filenames above
3. Place in this `images/agents/` directory
4. Refresh the dashboard to see the new images
